# Android developer task
## Overview

We've set up a simple NodeJS application which gives you a bunch of APIs to access and manipulate data. You will need to use these APIs and build an Android app. We prefer writing code using Android Studio. Follow the Android design guidelines <http://developer.android.com/design/get-started/principles.html>.

Feel free to make necessary changes in the server side code.

## API's
- `GET /api/message/` - get a list of messages
- `GET /api/message/:id` - get one message
- `DELETE /api/message/:id` - delete one message

**Your task, will be to consume these API's & build a UI which looks beautiful & more importantly feels intuitive. For an example of how the UI should look like, check out our CloudMagic Android App.**

## How to setup

- Make sure you have got node & npm installed
- Fork & clone this repo
- Navigate into src directory
- Execute `npm install` - this installs the dependencies
- Execute `npm start` - this will start the server
